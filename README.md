# **Emergency Department Analytics – Python, SQL & Tableau Project**

This project provides an end-to-end analysis of Emergency Department (ED) operations using Python, SQL, and Tableau.  
It focuses on patient flow, wait times, triage severity, departmental load, hourly arrivals, and congestion patterns.

---

## **📌 Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to understand Emergency Department performance through:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Operational analysis using SQL  
- Interactive visual dashboards in Tableau  
- KPI creation for ED workload monitoring  
- Identifying congestion, long waits, peak hours, and department utilization  

This project reflects strong skills in data wrangling, analytics, BI reporting, and healthcare data interpretation.

## **📁 Project Components**

### **1. Python (Pandas) – Data Cleaning**
- Cleaned & standardized raw ED dataset  
- Fixed inconsistent department names  
- Extracted arrival hour, day of week, triage fields  
- Calculated length of stay and wait-time metrics  
- Created flags for long waits, outliers, and shift classification  
- Exported cleaned dataset for SQL and Tableau  

---

### **2. SQL – Analytical Exploration**
Performed deeper ED analysis using MySQL, including:

- ED visit counts  
- Hourly and daily arrival trends  
- Department-level utilization  
- Average and aggregated wait-time metrics  
- Long-wait patient identification  
- Congestion and volume analysis  
- KPI validation and summary tables  

---

### **3. Tableau – Interactive Dashboards**

Two dashboards were created:

---

#### **📊 Dashboard 1: ED Operations Overview**
Includes:

- Total ED visits  
- Average wait time  
- Average length of stay  
- Department-wise patient volume  
- Daily patient arrival trends  

This dashboard highlights overall workload and operational performance of the ED.

---

#### **🔥 Dashboard 2: ED Flow & Congestion Overview**
Includes:

- Triage wait time heatmap  
- Hourly patient arrivals  
- Day vs Night shift comparison  
- Long-wait patient distribution  
- ED crowding levels (Normal / Busy / Overcrowded)  

This dashboard visualizes patient flow, congestion hours, bottlenecks, and workload intensity.

---

## **📈 Key Insights**

- Emergency Medicine had the highest patient volume  
- Longest waits occurred in triage levels 3–5  
- Peak congestion occurred between **4 PM – 8 PM**  
- Night shift patient volume was slightly higher than day shift  
- Several triage levels displayed significant wait-time outliers  
- Usage patterns indicate predictable hourly load cycles
